# COMMAND LINE TODO LIST
Simple todo list to put my ideas into one place.

In the code I'm using a simple script called colors.py I made with one simple function which can print colorful text.
In the show_menu() function i had to use raw print because of printing multiple colors on one line, i haven't yet figured out how to do that in a function
